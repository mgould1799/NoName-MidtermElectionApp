This jar file is a voting app called The Future of Freedom or FoF. FoF allows a user to create a username and password
to log in and vote. An admin can also log in to tally and print the votes from the system.

To run this, click on the NoName-MidertermElectionApp.jar file. It is important that the castedVotes.csv, userVoted.csv,
and voters.csv are within the same file as the jar file.
